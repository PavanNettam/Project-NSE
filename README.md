# Project-NSE
Computerised version of Indian stock market

brefing:

This project is to demonstrate the mini version of National Stock Exchange.
Stock market is basically a place where stocks are traded. In stock market the shares of publicly traded companies are issued and traded between the buyers and sellers.
In this project effort is made to demonstrate how the sales will happen in a stock market for a smaller scale of values. There are basically three levels in this program. The Level_1 contains the buyers and sellers column which is sorted in descending and ascending order respectively based on the costs. Here for the very first time an interesting concept named ‘Parallel Arrays' is being introduced where in, with one array(buyCost/sellCost) being controlled, the other one(buyCost/sellCost) if being changed accordingly. The cost values and the number of shares that the trader is asked to input initially. The Level_2 displays the highest cost value of the buyer’s column and the least cost value of the seller’s column. This is done for the traders reference, so as to know the current state of the market. The Level_3 consists of the display of the date and time at which a particular sale got executed, along with the cost at which it did. Therefore by this program the trader can get an idea of how the current cost of a
particular stock is varying with respect to time.
